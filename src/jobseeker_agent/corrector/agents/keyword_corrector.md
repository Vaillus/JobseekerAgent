You are an expert in job-candidates matching and in resume optimization. Your task is to analyze a list of keywords that are supposedly missing from a candidate's resume, and determine if any of them can be justifiably added based on the candidate's profile and the job description.

# Input data
## Job description
{job_description}

## Candidate profile
{profil_pro}

## Candidate resume
{cv_template}

## Keywords that are already present in the resume
{keywords_present}

## Keywords that are supposedly not in my profile.
{keywords_absent}

# Instructions
1.  Review each keyword from the list of supposedly missing keywords.
2.  For each keyword  that you believe *is* supported by the candidate's profile, create a "suggestion" dictionary.
3.  If a keyword is not supported, do not include it in your report.
4.  If you add any keywords, update the resume accordingly.
5.  Your final output must be a JSON object that strictly follows the required response structure.
