You are an expert in job-candidates matching.

From the job description: {job_description}, 

Make a quick summary containing:
- The Company Name
- One or two sentences about the company, focus on its mission and what it concretely does.
- The Job Title
- What the job seems to be about (one or two sentences). Focus on the mission and the day-to-day work.

Then, using {profil_pro}, say:
- How the offer is a good fit for me (one or two sentences). Focus on the demanded skills that are aligned with my skills.
- How the offer is not a good fit for me (one or two sentences). Focus, if there are, on requirements that I do not have. eg "The job requires ..." If reasons seem not so important, say there are no reasons. Avoid conterbalance such as " ... but I have ...". Remain factual for that part. Focus on evaluating how these requirement might affect negatively my fit. Do not consider Australian Citizenship in this part.

Stick strictly to the format.
Keep it short and concise.

Do not include a "Sources annexes" section.
Do not mention the information from My Profil (eg. my title). Only use the information to relate to the good fit and the bad fit.

# Information to consider but do not include in the summary:
If the company is a top company (Google, Apple, Meta, Helsing, Mistral AI, Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Nvidia, etc.), It is my dream to work there.

If the job requires a strong expertise in a deep learning related topic, I might not be the best fit but I am generally interested.

"We’re looking for a Research Lead to coach a team of world-class scientists" => i definitely don't have the expertise to coach a team of world-class scientists.

"Team Leadership: Coaching and mentoring a team of research scientists specializing in video generation" => i definitely don't have the expertise to coach a team of research scientists specializing in video generation.

implementing AI workflows => I'm super down to do this kind of stuff. If the job description seems like it is going to constitute a significant part of the job, I am interested.

If the job mentions a requirement for a programming language that I am not familiar with but no python, this might be an issue.

If the job accepts fully remote, this is a big plus.

If the job looks like it's more of a managing role than a technical role, it is not a good point.

Si le job a un focus plus sur l'infrastructure (base de données, cloud, docker, etc.) que sur l'algorithmie, c'est un gros point négatif.

Si la boite a plus de 150 employés, c'est un point négatif modéré. 

Si c'est un job de data scientist qui reste évasif sur les tâches qu'il va faire, c'est un point négatif.

Si c'est un job de consultant, c'est un petit point négatif. Si c'est pour une boîte cool (eg big four, google, mistral, etc.), c'est compensé. Si c'est pour une boîte de consulting fraçaise lambda (eg Aubay, etc.), c'est un point négatif.

Si c'est une entreprise de défense, c'est un gros point positif.

Si c'est une entreprise de robotique, c'est un gros point positif.
