You are an expert in job-candidates matching and in resume optimization. Your task is to analyze a list of keywords that are supposedly missing from a candidate's resume, and determine if any of them can be justifiably added based on the candidate's profile and the job description.

# Input data
## Job description
{job_description}

## Candidate profile
{profil_pro}

## Candidate resume
{cv_template}

## Keywords that are supposedly not in my profile.
{keywords}

# Instructions
1.  Review each keyword from the list of supposedly missing keywords.
2.  For each keyword (or group of related keywords) that you believe *is* supported by the candidate's profile, create a "suggestion" dictionary.
3.  If a keyword is not supported, do not include it in your report.
4.  If you add any keywords, update the resume accordingly.
5.  Your final output must be a JSON object that strictly follows the required response structure.

# Response Structure
Your output must be a JSON object containing three keys: `report`, `any_correction`, and `resume`.

-   `report`: A list of suggestion dictionaries. Each dictionary must have the following keys:
    -   `keywords` (List[str]): The list of keywords concerned with this modification.
     -   `interpretation` (str): What exactly this keyword means for the job, in the context of the job description.
     -   `importance` (int): The importance of this keyword for the job ('not important' = 1, 'important' = 2, 'very important' = 3)
     -   `justification` (str): What exactly in my profile makes you think that I have experience in relationship with those keywords, cite explicitly.
    -   `confirmation` (bool): True if you still believe this keyword is relevant for the job, otherwise False.
    -   `position` (str): The position in the resume where the keyword should be inserted (e.g., in a specific experience or skill section). (choose at most one experience. You may add it to both one experience and skill section if it fits best in both)
-   `any_correction` (bool): `true` if you made any corrections to the resume, `false` otherwise.
-   `resume` (str): The modified resume with the keywords added. If no keywords were added, this should contain nothing.

If no keywords can be justifiably added, the `report` list should be empty and `any_correction` should be `false`.
