# task
Suggest three opening lines for the begining of the resume.
The opening lines should be coherent with the current state of the resume.
Focus on what is expected of the candidate for the position and how they fit.
Use the synthesis and decision to inform the opening lines, they generally provide useful information about how the candidate is a good fit for the job.
The lines should be latex-compatible. That means, for example, that "&" characters must be "\&".
Do not mention experiences/skills that are not relevant for the role. (eg. If the job makes no mention of rl or OR, or decision-making, do not mention them in the opening lines.)


# Examples of good opening lines
- AI Engineer with a PhD in the optimization of decision-making algorithms and hands-on experience building impactful AI systems, from planning algorithms to LLM-powered workflows.
- AI Research Engineer specializing in autonomous decision-making systems. My background in Operations Research and Reinforcement Learning, combined with hands-on experience building ML systems, aligns with the challenge of developing SRE and Observability agents.
- Algorithm engineer with a Ph.D. in optimization and hands-on experience in real-time computer vision. My profile combines a strong machine learning background with a problem-solving approach to building and optimizing data-processing pipelines.
