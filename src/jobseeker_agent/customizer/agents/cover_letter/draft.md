# Task
Write a cover letter for the job using the template as inspiration.

Instructions:
1. Structure the letter with three main content paragraphs:
   - First paragraph: Identify the company's mission and how it corresponds to the candidate's profile
   - Second paragraph: Highlight 2 or 3 experiences or key skills (hard and soft skills) that correspond to the requirements of the offer. Illustrate always with concrete examples or quantified results. Mention them in the same order as in the resume.
   - Third paragraph: Write a wrap-up that summarizes what has been said by putting a term on my profile (e.g., "versatile problem solver"), and that reminds that I am fully aligned with their mission.

2. The cover letter should ideally be between 250 and 350 words long.

3. Do not lie about the candidate's skills and expertise.

4. Do not mention languages spoken by the candidate.

5. Instead of general affirmations, explicitly link the candidate's specific past achievements, skills, or projects to the specific requirements or mission of the role and the company. The connection must be shown, not merely stated.

Bad examples: 
- "My experience directly addresses the core responsibilities of this role."
- "My experience is a strong fit for the Machine Learning Engineer role."

Return as plain text only.
